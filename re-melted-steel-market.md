<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Re-melted Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) Process</li><li>Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The re-melted steel market consists of two main types: Electro Slag Remelting (ESR) Process and Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) Process. In the ESR process, an electric arc is used to melt the steel, while a layer of molten slag helps purify the steel by removing impurities. On the other hand, the VAR process uses an electric arc in a vacuum environment to melt the steel, resulting in a higher quality and more uniform product. Both processes are widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and power generation.</p></p>
