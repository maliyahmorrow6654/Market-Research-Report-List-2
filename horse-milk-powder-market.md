<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horse Milk Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Freeze-dried Powder</li><li>Hot Dry Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horse milk powder is available in two main market types: freeze-dried powder and hot dry powder. Freeze-dried powder is produced by freezing the liquid horse milk and then drying it under low pressure, removing the water content without damaging the nutrients. This process results in a powder that can be easily rehydrated. On the other hand, hot dry powder is made by spraying the liquid horse milk into hot air, causing the water to evaporate instantly. This method is quicker, but may lead to a slight reduction in nutritional value compared to freeze-dried powder.</p></p>
